# Among Us Moderator -- Mute All Participants
Built to mute all the participants present in a specific voice channel in a discord server. Created using Node.js, the GUI console used to mute the participants leverages the discord webhooks and discord.js v12.

## Want to implement it in your own server?
In the index.js file, add your own bot's token, your server's voice channel ID and in the console.py file (inside console folder) add your text channel's webhook URL. Also don't forget to add your webhook's name in the index.js message.author.username. Then all you need to do is to host it on heroku !
